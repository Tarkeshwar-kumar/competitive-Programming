/*
 *Depth First Search finds the lexicographical first path in the graph from a source vertex u to each vertex
 *Depth First Search will also find the shortest paths in a tree (because there only exists one simple path), but on
 *general graphs this is not the case.
 *
 *The algorithm works in O(m+n) time when n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.
